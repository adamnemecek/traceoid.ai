# traceoid.ai

[traceoid.ai](http://traceoid.ai) is scaling energy-based models (EBMs) by revisiting the math that underlies machine learning. [Here is what Yann LeCun had to say about EBMs](https://x.com/ylecun/status/1380066315600343042). Our interpretation of EBMs will provide: interpretability, composability [^composability], faster & cheaper training and inference etc.

__If we succeed, our approach will mark a significant step forward towards achieving AGI__.

Our thesis is that there is 100 years of physics and math research that has gone unnoticed by the CS/ML communities and we intend to rectify that.

## Careers

If you have background in one or ideally more of the following (and related) fields (or are excited to learn):
- [integrable systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrable_system)
- algebraic topology
- category theory
- functional programming
- compilers
- statistical mechanics
- computational physics
- quantum groups
- matroid theory
- harmonic analysis
- theorem provers
- CAS

please reach out. Ideal candidate would understand how one goes about writing high perf code as well as be able to explain the concept of a Hamiltonian.

__If you have experience with any of the above (or related), but have no machine learning experience, and are consider applying, please do not hesitate and reach out.__

Our company operates at the intersection of research & development, and as a part of this job, you will be reading papers and implementing some very cool research from the above fields.

We are currently in the final stages of establishing the company and to that end, we are in the process of working out the exact positions, salary ranges and such. As a result, we might not be officially hiring for another couple weeks. That being said, if the job sounds interesting, please do not hesitate and contact us at adamnemecek+careers@gmail.com or over [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mr9TAhpyBW).

All positions are fully remote.


## Investments

While we are currently finalizing investments, there might still be some space left in the current round, so if you are interested in hearing the pitch, please reach out to adamnemecek+vc@gmail.com or over [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mr9TAhpyBW).
