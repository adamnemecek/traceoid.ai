I’m building a startup to make energy-based models viable. One gains interpretability, composability (larger models from smaller), faster (cheaper) training and inference. I’m finalizing an investment round, but if you or someone you know want to invest, DM me. The math is crazy.

# Traceoid

[traceoid.ai](http://traceoid.ai) is making energy-based models (EBMs) viable by revisiting some of the math that underlies machine learning. [Here is what Yann LeCun had to say about EBMs](https://x.com/ylecun/status/1380066315600343042). Our interpretation of EBMs will provide: interpretability, composability (create larger models from smaller models), faster  & cheaper training and inference etc.

__If we succeed, our approach will mark a significant step forward towards achieving AGI__.

Our thesis is that there is 100 years of physics and math research that has gone unnoticed by the CS/ML communities and we intend to recify that.

## Carreers

If you have background in any of these or related fields (or are excited to learn): [integrable systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrable_system), category theory, functional programming, compilers, statistical mechanics, computational physics, please reach out. Ideal candidate would understand how one goes about writing high perf code as well as be able to explain the concept of a Hamiltonian.

Our company operates at the intersection of research & development, and as a part of this job, you will be reading papers and implementing some very cool research from the above fields. Ideal candidate would understand how one goes about writing high perf code as well as be able to explain the concept of a Hamiltonian.


We are currently in the final stages of establishing the company and to that end, we are in the process of working out the exact positions, salary ranges and such. As a result, we might not be officially hiring for another month or two. That being said, if the job sounds interesting, please do not hesitate and contact us at adamnemecek+hnhiring@gmail.com or over [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mr9TAhpyBW)


## Investments

While we are currently finalizing investments, there might still be some space left in the current round, so if you are interested in hearing the pitch, please reach out to [adamnemecek+hninvestments@gmail.com](https://discord.com/invite/mr9TAhpyBW).
